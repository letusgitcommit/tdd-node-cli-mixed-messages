# tdd-node-cli-mixed-messages
Codecademy portfolio project taken to the next level by using test-driven development.

While learning JavaScript on Codecademy, one of the capston projects is to build a random message generator with node.js to operate through the command line.
I wanted to take the opportunity to expand my TDD skillset and work on a small defined-scope project that would also introduce me to thinking about functional
testing through the command line.
