# User Story 1
Mark sits down, and wants to explore the various random messages that
could be generated by this new random message generator he just installed.
He opens up his favorite terminal/command line/shell, and types in the
command:
```shell
npm run
```
His node.js application runs, producing some random output. Satisfied,
he returns to whatever it was that he was doing previously.
